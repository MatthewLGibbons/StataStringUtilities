# Compatibility Fix
As part of a slower moving, but larger refactoring, I am making all my Java backed programs that rely on [Stata Java Utilities](https://github.com/wbuchanan/StataJavaUtilities) rely on this library to be installed locally.  
This will help prevent Method Not Found exceptions when there are two different versions of the library installed on the same machine from different versions of some of my software.
