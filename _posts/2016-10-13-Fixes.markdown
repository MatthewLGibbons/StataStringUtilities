Recently found out the package was not correctly installing.  Still need to try installation on other machines, but recompiled the binary against the updated Stata Java Utilities library.  This also affected a different OSX machine I have.  I've recompiled on that machine and it seems to have fixed the issue that caused the same problem to be reproduced on the other OSX machine.

```
net inst strutil, from("http://wbuchanan.github.io/StataStringUtilities/")
```
