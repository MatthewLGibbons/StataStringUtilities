* DESCRIPTION:                                                                *
*   Add information about what the strutil command does.                      *
*   Ex.                                                                       *
*   This program calls the strutil of the StringUtilities class.  This        *
*   method does a thing that I find useful and believe will help others as    *
*   well.                                                                     *
*                                                                             *
* DATA REQUIREMENTS:                                                          *
*   Does the program require any specific types of data/formatting?  If so,   *
*   make a note of it so you'll remember when debugging/helping users.        *
*                                                                             *
* JAVA REQUIREMENTS:                                                          *
*   The Stata Java API binary will already be on the class path.  But that    *
*   doesn't mean that users will have all of the binaries on their classpath  *
*   if it requires Java binaries that you can't distribute.  List these here  *
*   along with the JDK used for the build.                                    *
*   Requires JDK 1.8 or higher                                                *
*                                                                             *
* SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:                                                        *
*   Does the user need any special permissions/system configurations (e.g.,   *
*   a commonly defined DSN for an ODBC connection, admin permissions,         *
*   a private network connection, etc...).  If so, list that information      *
*                                                                             *
* INPUT REQUIREMENTS:                                                         *
*   If the program requires any specific variables and/or other elements to   *
*   operate on, you should list them here.  For example, if the program looks *
*   for files in a specific directory tree structure, you should include that *
*   here.                                                                     *
*                                                                             *
* OUTPUT:                                                                     *
*   What values/variables/results should the user expect?  List them here.    *
*                                                                             *

    I'd suggest passing in as many arguments as possible to the arguments option
    since it will make your Java plugin a bit less reliant on Stata for testing
    and debugging purposes (e.g., the args() option is the Stata version of the
    main(String[] args) method for a Java class).  If all the arguments are
    passed via the args parameter you should be able to throw a main method
    into the same class to test and debug the plugin from the command line
